Flower Watering Projetc! 

People around globe everyday have to remember a lot o things

I (maybe one day We) as <b> Grow Little flower </b> <i>(GLF for later) </i>group want to make life easier

My idea as GLF is to save as many plants life as possible and keep earth healthy, 
so this project is for people who have a lot on their heads, and sometimes forget about watering their plants
